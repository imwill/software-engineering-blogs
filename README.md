# A Collection of Corporate Software Engineering & Tech Blogs

## Introduction
This is a [collection of Corporate Software Engineering &amp; Tech blogs](/software-engineering-blogs.md). It features blogs of young startups, software development companies and also well-established companies who write about software engineering & technology.

I [published](http://imwill.com/18-favorite-software-engineering-tech-blogs/) a collection of my favorite blogs already more than 1.5 years ago. Now I got inspired by the [List of Free Programming Books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books) and decided to create this public repository.

## Contribution
Right now this collection is still small and incomplete. Please, feel free to add your own suggestions to it.

* Option A: [Fork it](https://github.com/imwill/software-engineering-blogs/fork), add your favorite blog or own company blog and send a Pull Request.
* Option B: Just [create a new issue](https://github.com/imwill/software-engineering-blogs/issues/new) and add a URL.
